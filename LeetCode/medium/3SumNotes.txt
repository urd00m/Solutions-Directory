if you move the initalization of vector<int> add to before the if statements you increase the runtime by a factor of 10

Other optimizations: 
1) stopping execution when you hit a postiive number
2) jumping to the last occurence of the number (exists[nums[j]+100000];) 
3) Using an array instead of map for truly O(1) searching
4) Duplicate check by making sure you don't check past indexes (i, j = i+1, k > j) or else you search something already searched 
5) ++I instead of I++
