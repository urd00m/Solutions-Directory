optimization was pass by reference for word
exiting immediately when finding the word
and for some reason when reversing the words as well 

Note: 
for the reverse optimization it probably is a bug in there test data where they forgot to also check a reversal of the strings, since theoretically speaking reversing the words
just adds extra runtime for no reason.
